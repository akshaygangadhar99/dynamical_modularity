Dynamical Modularity in Boolean networks
=======================================================

Code to analyze dynamical modularity in Boolean networks.  

This uses the Dynamics Canalization Map and schemata redescription code from the CANA package (https://github.com/rionbr/CANA).

See Multi-level_analysis.ipynb for code to calculate complex modules and analysis of complex modules in various genetric regulatory networks (GRNs).

More notebooks and scripts will be added shortly.

The corresponding paper is in preparation.
